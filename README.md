# About me
Hello and welcome!! My name is Rafael and it is a pleasure to have you here! 

Since when I started studying I tried always to help as much as I can everybody with what I knew and my goal is not different right now! Please, feel free to check any material here and please let me know if it is useful for you.

# My goal

My goal is to work as a member of Red Team one day so that's why I am studying a lot for that.
